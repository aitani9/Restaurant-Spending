# Restaurant-Spending
Android app that can be used for tracking a person's restaurant spending over time.

---

This app keeps track of a person's restaurant bills and how much total "leftover" money they have from their bills. When adding a bill, the user is asked for the amount of money they spent at the restaurant and how much money they were "allowed" to spend (and the date); determining how much is "allowed" could be based on different constraints for different people. For example, a college student might set a certain budget for themselves and only let themselves spend $15 dollars everyday when buying food at a restaurant. The "leftover" amount of money is  simply equal to the result of subtracting the amount of money spent from the amount of money allowed. If a user doesn't have an "allowed" amount of money, they can enter the same amount they spent for the amount of money allowed (or any other number really, if the user is comfortable with viewing a "wrong" amount of leftover money (amount other than $0)); for this type of user, the app would simply be a way of tracking their restaurant bills.

Possible future features list:
- [See TODO comments throughout project]
- Was possibly thinking we could turn this into a general "budget" app with different sections (e.g. a section for restaurants, a section for groceries, a "miscellaneous" section, etc.)
- Asking for the restaurant the person ate at when adding a bill (and probably changing the way the bills are displayed in the bill history if this is implemented)
- Allow the user to toggle the "money allowed" input option (and as a result not always add to the current leftover amount of money by default)
- Allow the user to remove the leftover money display altogether
- Restaurant suggestions
- Favorite restaurants
- Restaurants "near me"
- Feature where the user can assign certain restaurants to certain days of the week
