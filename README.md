# Restaurant-Spending-Tracker
Android app that can be used for tracking a person's restaurant spending over time

This app keeps track of a person's restaurant bills and how much total "leftover" money they
have from their bills. When adding a bill, the user is asked for the amount of money
they spent at the restaurant and how much money they were "allowed" to spend; determining
what is allowed could be based on different constraints for different people. For example,
a college student might set a certain budget for themselves and only let themselves spend
$15 dollars everyday when buying food at a restaurant. The "leftover" amount of money is 
simply equal to the result of subtracting the amount of money spent from the amount of money
allowed. If a user doesn't have an "allowed" amount of money, they can input the amount they
spent as the amount of money allowed as well; for this type of user, the app would simply be
a way of tracking their restaurant bills.
